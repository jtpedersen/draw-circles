A series of test for a fast way to draw circles for discrete sibson interpolation on the CPU

1. make init (create build dir)
2. make release=1
3. ./main [CNT] [TEST] [SEED]

CNT: number of circles to draw
TEST: 
   0: naive
   1: version with two buffers
   2: version with one buffer
   3: run 1 the 2 good with watch ./main $((512**2)) 3

SEED: seed for random number generator


in main.cpp there is code and some defines to use a lookup-table and presorting.
